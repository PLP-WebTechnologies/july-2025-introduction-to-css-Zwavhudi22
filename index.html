    <p>
      <strong>A Granny Square</strong> is a crocheted square made by stitching in rounds from center outward.
        These squares are always handmade, as machines can't replicate the crochet technique, and they
        often look like thick lace. While it's possible to make one large granny square, crafters typically
        create many small ones called <em>motifs</em> which they then join together to form items like clothes, bags,
        blankets, and other home accesories.
